# Carnot

Carnot is a work-in-progress toy 3D game engine written in Rust using [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs). It is a personal project that I am using as a opportunity to:

- Learn about modern graphics APIs
- Study and implement modern rendering pipelines and game engine architecture
- Practice building a large system
- Gain experience with Rust, its ecosystem, and its best practices

> "Carnot" (French pronunciation: [ka Åno]) is a reference to French physicist Sadi Carnot and the Carnot engine, a theoretical ideal heat engine with maximum efficiency. I hope it will be a fitting name for a project that aims to explore optimizations for performance and efficiency in rendering and game engine design.

## Development Log

I maintain a development log in [DEVLOG.md](DEVLOG.md) where I document my progress, thoughts, and decisions as I work on Carnot.
