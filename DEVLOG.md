# Carnot Development Log

## 2024-03-26

In this first entry, I will outline the goals and motivations for this project.

Currently, I am focusing on researching modern approaches to rendering and game engine architecture. In particular, I aim to research and implement:

- A render graph system
- A physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline
- An entity-component-system (ECS) architecture

I am also using this project as an opportunity to gain experience reading and writing idiomatic Rust.
